# Google Apps Script Financial Model

This directory contains Google Apps Script code for your financial model spreadsheet.

## How to Use

1. **Paste your existing code** into `Code.gs` (or create separate files as needed)
2. **We'll iterate** on the code together in Cursor
3. **Copy the final code** from the `.gs` files and paste into Google Sheets:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Go to Extensions → Apps Script
   - Replace the code in `Code.gs` with the code from this project
   - Save and run

## File Structure

- `Code.gs` - Main Apps Script code (paste your existing code here)
- Additional `.gs` files can be created for separate modules/functions

## Notes

- Google Apps Script uses JavaScript (ES5), so some modern JS features may not be available
- All code here is ready to copy/paste directly into Google Sheets Apps Script editor
